In order to do that, we need to first define how they will be brought into Grooper. In this phase, we will: create our first Batch Process, add a Scan step to our Batch Process, create a Scan Profile that defines how our documents will be brought into Grooper, and use these settings to virtually scan pages into a batch. Let's get started! Batch Process \u00b6 When it comes to processing documents, you typically don't do it only one time and get to forget about it, right? It's usually done on a regular basis. We want to start building out steps to make that process as automated as possible. Creating a Batch Process \u00b6 The first thing we want to do is create a Batch Process. Step 1 Open Grooper Design Studio and expand the node tree to (root) > Batch Processing > Process and select the Working node. Step 2 Create a new Batch Process by either: right-clicking on the Working node and selecting Add > Batch Process... , or clicking Add in the toolbar and selecting Batch Process... . Naming the Batch Process \u00b6 Before our Process can be created, we have to give it a name. Step 3 Name the Batch Process Invoices Process (or anything that makes you happy) and click OK . Adding a step \u00b6 Congratulations! You've just created your first Batch Process. You can see the new process under the (root) > Batch Processing > Processes > Working node. Now we can start building it! By default, a new Process will be empty when we create it. We want to start adding the steps through which our batches are going to run. We'll start with a simple Scan step for now, and add more steps in later. Step 4 In the Steps in Batch Process panel, click the Add Step... button. Step 5 This will create a blank step in our Process. Setting the new step's Activity Type \u00b6 We've added a step to our Process, but we have an error in our Validation Errors panel. This will tell us what issues Grooper found with this Process and where they are located. If we read the error, it tells us that our New Step \u2022 Activity Type 's value is required. We've added a step to our process, but it's currently blank, meaning we haven't specified which activity we want Grooper to perform here. This is like saying, \"I want you to do something here, but I haven't told you what it is yet.\" Step 6 In the Step Properties panel, select the Activity Type property and choose Scan from the dropdown list. Step 7 Our validation error should go away now that we've satisfied the requirement. Note In Grooper, \"scanning\" doesn't necessarily have to mean that you're using a physical device to scan documents. There are many ways documents can be brought in, including (but not limited to) scanning, file system import, and email import. Save and publish the Batch Process \u00b6 We're done adding our first step, so now we want to test it out. Info Batch Processes must first be published in order to be used. This is to allow development of a Process without users having access to changes before they're ready. Step 8 Click Save to save our changes. Step 9 Click Publish to make this Batch Process available for production use. Step 10 After the Batch Process is published, you will see that the (root) > Batch Processing > Processes > Published node now has a child that looks exactly like the Working node. Warning Published Batch Processes cannot (and should not!) be edited. If you wish to make any changes to a published Batch Process, first make the change in the appropriate working process, then re-publish. Tip If you wish to remove a published Process from production use, simply click the \"Unpublish\" button on its working process. Scanning \u00b6 We've created our process and added a scan step to it. Now we need to tell Grooper that when we run a batch through this process, how we want this scan step to bring in our documents. Recall that \"scanning\" in Grooper doesn't necessarily mean \"scanning\" in the traditional sense. Instead of scanning pages through a physical scanner, we're going to import them from a folder on the computer. To start off, we're going to need to tell Grooper how we're going to bring these documents into our batch. We want to create something reusable so that this process can be repeated in the future. Note One great feature of Grooper is its modularity. We can create a preset for something like scanning so that it may be used in multiple places. We call these presets profiles. Creating a Scanner Profile \u00b6 Let's begin by creating a Scanner Profile. Step 1 Right-click on the (root) > Global Resources > Scanner Profiles folder, hover over Add > and select Scanner Profile... This will open the Add New Scanner Profile name dialog. Step 2 Give it a name (we'll be using the exciting name Scan Profile for the rest of this instruction) and click OK . Configuring the Scanner Profile \u00b6 Way to go! You've just created your first Scanner Profile. You're on a roll! You can see it in the node tree under (root) > Global Resources > Scanner Profiles . This is the default Scanner Profile configuration screen. Let's set it up so we can use it. Choosing a scan method \u00b6 We first need to set which of the various \"scan\" methods our profile will be using. Step 3 In the Properties panel, in the General section, click on the Selected Device property. Step 4 Click the drop-down on the right and select File System Import . Info If you have scanner drivers installed, you will probably see ISIS and TWAIN in this list as well. Step 5 Click the Device Settings property, and then click the ellipsis button to the right. This will bring up the configuration settings for whichever device you chose from the previous step. Step 6 Because we chose File System Import as our device, this will bring up the File System Import Settings panel. Setting the import path \u00b6 We're going to be importing, so we need to tell Grooper where to look. Step 7 Click the Import Path property. There are two ways you can set the path: You can click the ellipsis to the right and browse for the path. This is useful if the files are located locally. If you know the path and are able to copy it to your clipboard, you can simply paste the path in here. This is useful for shared UNC paths. Step 8 Click OK . We don't need to change any of the other settings here, but feel free to click on them and read their descriptions to learn more about them. This will bring us back to our Scanner Profile configuration node. Saving \u00b6 Step 9 We're done here, so click Save to save the changes we've made so far. Production Batch \u00b6 We're ready to test out what we've built so far! We're going to create a production batch with our new Process, so now we want to see what happens when a batch runs through it. Creating a batch \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches . Note In the (root) > Batch Processing > Batches node, you will be able to see all batches in your environment, including test batches. To limit your list of batches to either test or production, select the appropriate child node. Step 2 In the Batches Folder tab, click on Batch > New... . The Batch Properties window will appear. This is where we specify which Batch Process we want to associate with the batch we are trying to create, as well as optionally giving the batch a name other than the default date/timestamp. We currently have only one process, so the choice is pretty easy. Configuring the batch properties \u00b6 Step 3 Give your batch an intuitive name, such as Invoices Batch . Step 4 From the Batch Process dropdown, select Invoices Process . Step 5 We're done here, so click OK to return close this window and create our batch. Step 6 Back in Grooper Design Studio we should see our new batch in our list. If you click on the batch, you can see where it's at in the process. Currently, it's on the Scan step. The progress bar is gray, which means it's in \"Pending\" status. That means that this activity is ready to begin. Info Depending on the type of activity, the batch process step may begin processing automatically. For this to happen, two criteria have to be met: the activity type must be an unattended activity, and there must exist an active Grooper service to handle task processing. Tip You have the ability to rename your batch after it has already been created. From the Batches Folder , select the batch and click the Pause button in the toolbar. Right-click on the batch and select Properties . Rename the batch and click OK . Processing the batch \u00b6 Step 7 Make sure your batch is selected, and click the Process button. This tells Grooper to begin processing this activity. This will bring up the Attended Client window for the Scan activity. Step 8 Click the Scanner Profile dropdown. This is where all of our Scan Profiles would appear if we had more than one. We have only one, so select it from the list. Now we're ready to scan! Step 9 Click the big Scan button. This will activate the Scan Profile we selected, which is configured to look in our file system and pull in any images it finds in there. As the pages are scanned in, their images will display in the panel on the right. Step 10 We're done scanning in our pages, so in the toolbar, click the Complete Task button. This is like telling Grooper, \"I'm done with this task, so move on to the next step in the process.\" This will close Attended Client and return us to Grooper Design Studio. Note There may be times when you may have more pages to scan into your batch, but can't do it at that moment. In situations like that, you wouldn't necessarily want to use Complete Task , because it will take the batch as-is and move it on to the next step. If you're scanning in Attended Client and want to return to the batch later, click the Stop button instead. This will return the batch to a \"Pending\" state. When you are ready to come back to it, click Process again, and it will pick up where you left off, with all of your already-scanned pages still present. Tip If you need to rescan a page or pages, you can right-click on them in the Batch Viewer. There are a few things you can do from this context menu, so feel free to hover over the options and read the tooltips to see what they can do. Observing the results \u00b6 Step 11 Back in Grooper Design Studio, take a look at our batch. The progress bar should now be blue, which means that this activity is complete. Recap \u00b6 We just completed the Acquire phase! It may seem like all we've done is scan in a few pages, but we've taken our first steps to processing a batch from beginning to end. Here's a list of everything we learned: how to create a Batch Process, how to add steps to a Batch Process, how to create a Scan Profile that can be utilized to bring in images, how to create a production batch, and how to use our new Batch Process and Scan Profile to add pages to our new batch. When we look at it that way, it seems a bit more impressive! Up next \u00b6 You may or may not have noticed, but some of the pages we scanned in didn't look very good. They were skewed and needed a little bit of image cleanup. In the next section, we'll learn how to clean these images up, and then how to use the clean images to obtain text that we can work with.","title":"Acquire"},{"location":"vol-1/acquire/#acquire","text":"","title":"Acquire"},{"location":"vol-1/acquire/#overview","text":"We know that we have a bunch of invoice documents that we need to process.

Imagine we have a pile of papers in our inbox. We can think of this as the batch we just made, so they arrived there via the Acquire phase. If we had to work through these documents by hand, we'd probably have to go through them and make sure they're all facing the same way, remove any sticky notes on them, take out the staples, and potentially white out smudges and marks. This is the Condition phase, and we can automate these tasks in Grooper. In this phase, we will: create and test an Image Processing Profile, use the new profile to clean up our batch, and use OCR to obtain text from our images that we'll use later. Let the conditioning commence! But first \u00b6 For the next few phases, we'll be testing the results of adding a single Batch Process step at a time. Let's take a deeper look at our batch so that when we start adding steps, the process makes a little bit more sense.

You can simply view the batch by clicking on the Batch Viewer tab. Step 2 Click the + button next to the batch in the node tree to expand it. Notice that there are two child objects here: \u2514\u2500 Invoices Batch \u251c\u2500 Invoices Batch \u2514\u2500 Invoices Process a folder with the same name as the batch, and a gear icon with the name of the Batch Process we used to create the batch. Note When you create a production batch and assign it a particular Batch Process, it attaches a copy of that Process to that batch. This is to ensure that, should there be any changes to the process after the batch is created, it won't affect how this batch is processing. An important note is that because this Process is only a copy of the original, it doesn't maintain a link to the original. If we want to make changes to the Process and subsequently test those changes against an batch, we need to tell that batch to update. This is like telling Grooper, \"Hey, I've changed the steps I want you to take when you process.\" We'll be doing this quite a few times, so it won't hurt to become familiar with the technique! Cloning to test \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate back up the node tree to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process > Invoices Batch . We need to clean up our batch images, so we're going to create an Image Processing Profile to do that. However, profiles can be tested only against test batches, so we can't use our production batch. We can, however, clone our production batch to our test batches. This way we don't have to create a brand new test batch to work with. Step 2 Click the Clone To Test button, and then Execute on the window that appears. Warning Make sure you click the Clone To Test button and NOT the Clone button in the upper toolbar. Clone To Test makes an exact replica of the batch in the test batches. Clone is a way to create an exact copy of an object in-place in the node tree. If we used this option instead, we would have two identical production batches (and we'd have to rename the second one). Once the clone is complete, you will see a confirmation window; click OK . Now you can view the cloned batch by navigating to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Test > Production Clones > Invoices Process > Invoices Batch ( root ) \u251c\u2500 Batch Processing | \u251c\u2500 Batches | | \u251c\u2500 Production | | \u2514\u2500 Test | | \u2514\u2500 Production Clones | | \u2514\u2500 Invoices Process | | \u2514\u2500 Invoices Batch | \u251c\u2500 Control Sheets | \u251c\u2500 Processes | \u2514\u2500 Projects \u251c\u2500 Content Models \u251c\u2500 Data Extraction \u2514\u2500 ... Image Processing \u00b6 Our current objective is to clean up the images, which we learned is done via an Image Processing Profile (or \"IP Profile\"). We can start creating one now that we've got a batch against which we can test it. Creating an IP Profile \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Global Resources > IP Profiles . ( root ) \u251c\u2500 Batch Processing \u251c\u2500 Content Models \u251c\u2500 Data Extraction \u251c\u2500 Global Resources | \u2514\u2500 IP Profiles \u251c\u2500 Infrastructure \u2514\u2500 Reports Step 2 Right-click on this node and click Add > IP Profile... . Step 3 Give the profile a name, such as Invoices IP Profile , and click OK . Configuring the IP Profile \u00b6 Once you have your IP Profile created, you should see the configuration screen. Setting up an IP Profile is a bit like setting up a Batch Process. We'll create a list of things to do (called \"commands\") when the profile runs against a page. Then we'll actually get to test it out against our test batch before we put it into production. Selecting a batch \u00b6 Step 1 From the Batch dropdown, select our cloned Invoices Batch . We're going to build the profile, but we first need to select a batch for testing, otherwise we won't know if the commands we're adding will work. After you select the batch, it will appear in the batch viewer below. Let's add a command! Adding a Deskew command \u00b6 The first thing we want to do is deskew the images. Step 2 Click the Add button, and then click on Image Transforms > Auto Deskew . You should now see the \"Auto Deskew\" command in the list in the \"Child Element\" column. Tip If you're not seeing an image in the lower right panel, click on one of the pages in the batch. Tip When adding commands, if you're unsure what their purposes are, hover over them with your cursor. A tooltip will pop up and give you a brief description. In the panel below, there are different properties that you can modify for each command, but we're going to leave these ones at their default configurations. Let's test it out so far to make sure it's working. Testing the command \u00b6 Step 3 Click the Execute button in the toolbar. Keep your eye on the image in the lower right panel. This will run all commands in the list against the selected page from top to bottom. If you were watching, you probably noticed that the image did rotate, but now we have some extra white space around the edges that we didn't have before. That's okay, because we have plenty of other commands at our disposal to take care of that. Right now our primary concern is that the text is oriented correctly (we'll talk about why here in a bit). Step 4 In the lower right panel, click the rightmost magnifying glass to zoom the image to fit the panel. This will make it easier to see. You can see the effect your commands have on your image by switching back and forth between Result Image and Original Image . Check it out on page two. Step 5 Click Save . Tip Save often! A good rule of thumb is to save every time you make a change you know you're going to keep. We're done with the Deskew command. Remember that the goal is to make sure the text is displayed in horizontal lines, so try not to focus on the border skew. Speaking of borders, let's take care of them. Border cleanup commands \u00b6 Step 6 Click Add , and then Border Cleanup > Auto Border Crop . We aren't going to change any of the default properties, so let's see what happens. Step 7 Click Execute , and click back and forth between the images to see the changes. Tip As you're building an IP Profile and adding and testing commands, make sure you are on the Result Image to see if your configuration is working. It's not unusual to be adding commands and not see any changes in your image, only to realize you never switched over from the Original Image view! Note The Border Crop command changes the size of your image. You can see this in the information panel below the image itself. Our Border Crop works pretty well, but there are some images that still have a bit leftover. We don't necessarily want to increase the size of our crop because we risk cutting off any text that might be close to the edge of the page (for example, Page 7 in our batch). We'll take care of that another way. Step 8 Save the profile. Step 9 Select Page 1 in our batch. Click on Add , and then select Border Cleanup > Border Fill. Note When you click on a page in the batch viewer, it automatically runs all commands against that page. The only time you need to use the Execute button is when you're adding commands and you want to run them against your current page without navigating away from it. If you click on Execute , nothing happens. That tells us that the default properties for this command probably need to be tweaked for us to see results. Step 10 Select the Border Fill command. Change the Border Region Size property to 25pt . This is increasing how far inward from the border Grooper will look when running this command. Yet, once again, Execute yields no results. Step 11 Select Page 9 in our batch. Change the Method property to Inclusive . Step 12 Click Execute and check out the results. Note Unlike the Border Crop command, Border Fill does not change the size of your image. This is because this command serves to fill in the edge of the page with whatever color is set in the Fill Color property. We're not changing the size of the page, only the stuff on it. Step 13 Click Add and select Feature Detection > Patch Code Detection . Save the profile. Adding to the Batch Process \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Processes > Working > Invoices Process . Step 2 Click Add Step... . Step 3 In the Properties for our new empty step, change the Activity Type to Image Processing . Set the IP Profile on the right to the IP Profile we just got done making. Step 4 Save and Publish our process. Updating the production batch \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process > Invoices Batch > Invoices Process . Notice how the Batch Process that is attached to this batch didn't receive the new step we just added. Remember that when this batch was created, the process had only the \"Scan\" step. We want to tell this batch to check out the changes we made to the process so that it can run through the new Image Processing step. Step 2 Navigate back up to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process . Select the batch from the list, and then go to Batch > Update Process... . The Update Process window will appear. Step 3 Select Target Step . From the dropdown on the right, select the Image Processing step, and then click Execute . We're telling Grooper, \"Update the process on this batch. We're using this process, and I want you to start processing at this step.\" We will return to Grooper Design Studio, only now our batch's Task Status panel has another step in it. The task doesn't have a progress bar because the batch is still paused. Step 4 Click on the Resume Batch button, and then Execute on the confirmation window that appears. Now the batch has a gray progress bar for the Image Processing step. We know this means that it's ready and waiting for us to tell it to start this activity. Before we do that, let's look at what we just did. Step 5 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process > Invoices Batch > Invoices Process and expand it. Now we see that there's an Image Processing step that wasn't here the last time we looked. This is the result of the Update Process... that we did to the batch. The batch received the latest updates from our Invoices Process , which had a new step, so now it's ready to run it! Step 6 Navigate back up to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process , select the batch, and click the Process button. You'll see the Grooper Unattended Client window appear. This is the part of the Grooper suite that processes unattended activities . When this shows up, you don't need to press anything - it will start working automatically. If you take a look at the Image Processing step, you can see it working on the pages. When it's done, it will have a blue progress bar similar to the Scan step. But how do we know that it actually worked, and that our images have been correctly cleaned up? Image Review \u00b6 In a production environment, you might want to have users review the images before they move on to any other steps in your Batch Process. In Grooper, we can do this with an Image Review step. This is an attended activity that will display the batch to the users and give them an opportunity to approve or rescan any images that need it. Adding an Image Review step \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process . Click Add Step... . Under Properties of Image Review Step , set the Activity Type to Image Review . Save and Publish the process. Now we need to go update our batch. Step 2 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process . Pause the batch. Select the Batch dropdown and select Update Process... . In the Update Process window, select the Image Review step from the Target Step dropdown. Click Execute . We should see another step in the Task Status panel, just like when we added Image Processing . Step 3 Resume the batch. Step 4 Click Process to start this activity. Image Review is an attended activity, so clicking Process will open up the Grooper Attended Client module (like it did when we scanned). Opening Image Review \u00b6 Step 5 Click on the Thumbnail Viewer tab. This gives us an easy way to see all of the thumbnails of the batch at a glance. If you haven't noticed yet, there are a few blank pages in this batch. We don't really care about processing those, so let's get rid of them. Step 6 In the Thumbnail Viewer , click the Sort button in the upper right corner. Step 7 Select the Sort By Intensity option. This will arrange the images by how intense they are, based on the black pixel count. Images will be arranged from top to bottom by least amount of black pixels to most. Note This does not permanently arrange the images in this order. This is just a technique to see how many blank pages we have. If you scroll to the top, you can see all of the pages with the least amount of black pixels - the blank pages we want to remove. Deleting blank pages \u00b6 Step 8 Select the blank pages. You can do this in the same way you select files on your computer. Using your Ctrl key and clicking on the page you want to select Clicking the first blank page, holding Shift on your keyboard, and then clicking on the last blank page Delete the pages. Either: press the Delete key on your keyboard, or right click on the selected pages and select Delete . Confirm the deletion when the confirmation window comes up. Ta-da! They're all gone. Note This is only one of many ways that blank pages can be removed in Grooper. Step 9 Click back over to the Batch Viewer tab. Notice that the order of the pages didn't actually change, and now our batch is free of any blank pages. Verifying the images \u00b6 In order to complete this activity, the images have to be verified. This means that they need to be checked to make sure the previous step (Image Processing) worked correctly on all of the pages. To verify that an image has been reviewed, you can: 1. right click on the image and click Mark As Reviewed , or 2. press the Enter key on your keyboard. You know an image has been reviewed when there is a green \u2713 on the image. Each image has to be reviewed before the Complete Task button in the toolbar will light up, so it's probably easiest to press the Enter key for each of these. Step 10 Make sure every image in the batch has been marked as reviewed. Tip For this exercise, Image Processing works on all of the pages. To complete this step quickly, select the first page in the batch and hold your Enter key down. It will quickly verify all of the pages in the batch. When you have reviewed all of the pages in the batch, the Complete Task button in the toolbar will light up. Step 11 Click the Complete Task button to finish this activity and return to Grooper Design Studio. And that's it! We've successfully cleaned up our images. But now what do we do? OCR \u00b6 You may be wondering why it's so important for us to have the images as clean as we can get them? Why can't we just store them however they came in? They weren't that bad, right? Well, believe it or not, there is a reason behind the madness. About OCR \u00b6 Remember that our overarching goal with Grooper is to automate the process of processing documents, collecting information from them, and sending them on their way. We're well on our way to getting that information from the documents, but we have to do a few things to prepare Grooper to get the information for us. What is OCR? \u00b6 We're going to be performing what's called OCR, which stands for \"optical character recognition.\" This means we're going to tell Grooper to look at the images in our batch, identify what on these images is text, and store that text for us to use later. Image someone who doesn't know how to read. Letters on a page would simply look like a bunch of symbols without meaning, right? Now image that that person is a computer. For a scanned document, a computer doesn\u2019t even know the symbol is a letter, but instead an arbitrary combination of pixels. The OCR process is how the computer takes an image and, line by line , finds combinations of pixels that it ultimately determines are letters, numbers, spaces, special characters, and so on. For this to happen successfully, the quality of the images has to be as high as possible. If we tried to OCR low-quality images, the text identified by the OCR engine won't be very good, which essentially breaks down everything we do from this point forward. When do I need to OCR? \u00b6 To harness all the power of Grooper, pages must be OCRed. There are perhaps very simple batch processes that could be created that utilized human interaction for every step, and in that case OCR would not be required, but that\u2019s like buying a Ferrari to take trips to the grocery store. All the power of Grooper, from separation, to classification, to extraction, leverages the computer\u2019s ability to read the document, and to that end require a page be OCRed. Therefore it is crucial to have the highest quality documents we can get in order for the automation process to run as smoothly as possible. How does OCR work? \u00b6 Check out this video on Wikipedia. It\u2019s a nice demonstration of a very manual approach to OCR. You can see the person live scanning the document, line by line, and the computer \u201creads\u201d the letters as the scanning happens. With Grooper, page scanning happens (usually) all at once. During the OCR process the image is broken into vertical and horizontal lines of pixels to identify individual letter characters and spacing. | TO-DO THESE STEPS NEED EXPLANATION. Adding an OCR step \u00b6 Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Processes > Working > Invoices Process . Click Add Step... . Under Properties of OCR Step , set the Activity Type to OCR . Under Properties of OCR Activity , set the OCR Profile to Full Text - Accurate . Save and Publish the process. Step 2 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process . Pause the batch. Select the Batch dropdown and select Update Process... . In the Update Process window, select the OCR step from the Target Step dropdown. Click Execute . Step 3 Resume the batch. Click Process to kick off the OCR activity. The Grooper Unattended Client should kick off again and start processing against the pages in the batch. TO-DO Insert information about OCR and unattended client (images 36-39) Recap \u00b6 That's it for the Condition phase! We've successfully prepped our images and extracted text from them. Here's a list of everything we learned: - how to clone a batch from production to test, - how to create an Image Processing Profile (or \"IP Profile\"), - how to configure our IP Profile to clean up our images, - how to update an existing batch when you change its Batch Process, - how to perform Image Review on the images, and - how to extract text from the images using Optical Character Recognition (or \"OCR\") And thus your arsenal of Grooper knowledge grows! Up next \u00b6 We currently have a batch of loose pages with some patch code sheets. This batch consists of multiple invoices, but Grooper isn't aware of that yet. You and I know where one invoice ends and another begins, so it's up to us to tell Grooper how to recognize that as well.","title":"Condition"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#condition","text":"","title":"Condition"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#overview","text":"Remember that our goal for using Grooper is to automate tasks that we would otherwise have to perform manually.

If we had to work through these documents by hand, we'd probably have to go through them and make sure they're all facing the same way, remove any sticky notes on them, take out the staples, and potentially white out smudges and marks. This is the Condition phase, and we can automate these tasks in Grooper. In this phase, we will: create and test an Image Processing Profile, use the new profile to clean up our batch, and use OCR to obtain text from our images that we'll use later.

Now we see that there's an Image Processing step that wasn't here the last time we looked. This is the result of the Update Process... that we did to the batch. The batch received the latest updates from our Invoices Process , which had a new step, so now it's ready to run it! Step 6 Navigate back up to (root) > Batch Processing > Batches > Production > Invoices Process , select the batch, and click the Process button. You'll see the Grooper Unattended Client window appear. This is the part of the Grooper suite that processes unattended activities . When this shows up, you don't need to press anything - it will start working automatically. If you take a look at the Image Processing step, you can see it working on the pages. When it's done, it will have a blue progress bar similar to the Scan step. But how do we know that it actually worked, and that our images have been correctly cleaned up?","title":"Updating the production batch"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#image-review","text":"In a production environment, you might want to have users review the images before they move on to any other steps in your Batch Process.

This will arrange the images by how intense they are, based on the black pixel count. Images will be arranged from top to bottom by least amount of black pixels to most. Note This does not permanently arrange the images in this order. This is just a technique to see how many blank pages we have.

This means that they need to be checked to make sure the previous step (Image Processing) worked correctly on all of the pages. To verify that an image has been reviewed, you can: 1. right click on the image and click Mark As Reviewed , or 2. press the Enter key on your keyboard. You know an image has been reviewed when there is a green \u2713 on the image. Each image has to be reviewed before the Complete Task button in the toolbar will light up, so it's probably easiest to press the Enter key for each of these. Step 10 Make sure every image in the batch has been marked as reviewed. Tip For this exercise, Image Processing works on all of the pages. To complete this step quickly, select the first page in the batch and hold your Enter key down. It will quickly verify all of the pages in the batch. When you have reviewed all of the pages in the batch, the Complete Task button in the toolbar will light up.

We're well on our way to getting that information from the documents, but we have to do a few things to prepare Grooper to get the information for us.","title":"About OCR"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#what-is-ocr","text":"We're going to be performing what's called OCR, which stands for \"optical character recognition.\" This means we're going to tell Grooper to look at the images in our batch, identify what on these images is text, and store that text for us to use later. Image someone who doesn't know how to read. Letters on a page would simply look like a bunch of symbols without meaning, right? Now image that that person is a computer. For a scanned document, a computer doesn\u2019t even know the symbol is a letter, but instead an arbitrary combination of pixels. The OCR process is how the computer takes an image and, line by line , finds combinations of pixels that it ultimately determines are letters, numbers, spaces, special characters, and so on. For this to happen successfully, the quality of the images has to be as high as possible. If we tried to OCR low-quality images, the text identified by the OCR engine won't be very good, which essentially breaks down everything we do from this point forward.","title":"What is OCR?"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#when-do-i-need-to-ocr","text":"To harness all the power of Grooper, pages must be OCRed. There are perhaps very simple batch processes that could be created that utilized human interaction for every step, and in that case OCR would not be required, but that\u2019s like buying a Ferrari to take trips to the grocery store. All the power of Grooper, from separation, to classification, to extraction, leverages the computer\u2019s ability to read the document, and to that end require a page be OCRed. Therefore it is crucial to have the highest quality documents we can get in order for the automation process to run as smoothly as possible.","title":"When do I need to OCR?"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#how-does-ocr-work","text":"Check out this video on Wikipedia. It\u2019s a nice demonstration of a very manual approach to OCR. You can see the person live scanning the document, line by line, and the computer \u201creads\u201d the letters as the scanning happens. With Grooper, page scanning happens (usually) all at once. During the OCR process the image is broken into vertical and horizontal lines of pixels to identify individual letter characters and spacing. | TO-DO THESE STEPS NEED EXPLANATION.","title":"How does OCR work?"},{"location":"vol-1/condition/#adding-an-ocr-step","text":"Step 1 Navigate to (root) > Batch Processing > Processes > Working > Invoices Process .
