# Organize

## Overview

Thinking back to our real-world scenario, what might we need to do next if we were processing these documents by hand?

We probably don't want to throw all of our invoices into one giant file and call it a day, right? (Well, we might *want* to, but we have to at least pretend like we're responsible!)

If we were ultimately going to store these documents in a file cabinet somewhere, we would need to separate them using file folders so that one invoice doesn't get mixed up with another. We would also need to have some kind of label on the folders so we can easily identify what the folder contains and what information it has.

We have to do the same things with Grooper, and these are done in the **Organize** phase.

In this phase, we will:

- create a **Separation Profile**,
- use the new profile to separate our invoices into individual folders,
- learn about classification and content types,
- train Grooper to recognize our documents so it knows what information to get from them, and
- update our Batch Process to do all of this automatically in the future.

Let's get organized!
